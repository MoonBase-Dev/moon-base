# Moon Base - A Starship Visual Editor

Moon Base is a visual editor designed to help you create, customize, and manage your [Starship](https://starship.rs/) prompt configuration files (`starship.toml`) with ease. It provides a user-friendly interface to tweak various settings, modules, and palettes, offering a live preview of both your prompt and the generated TOML output.

## ✨ Features

## 🚀 How to Use

Moon Base is designed to be intuitive. Here's a general workflow:

1.  **Project Setup**:
    *   Ensure you have an `assets` directory at the root of your project.
    *   Place the application logo, named `image.png`, inside this `assets` folder. The application expects it at `./assets/image.png`.

2.  **Access the Application**: Open `index.html` in your web browser.

3.  **Select a Template (Optional)**:
    *   On the left panel, under "Templates," you can choose a predefined template from the dropdown menu.
    *   The Moon Base logo (the `image.png` you added) is displayed below this section.
    *   Details of the selected template will appear below the dropdown.
    *   This is a great starting point if you're new or want a base to customize.

4.  **Customize Global Settings**:
    *   In the central panel, expand the "Global Settings" section.
    *   Modify settings like "Global Prompt Format" (`format`), "Right Prompt Format" (`right_format`), "Add Newline," etc.
    *   These settings define the overall structure and behavior of your prompt.

5.  **Configure Modules**:
    *   Scroll down to the "Modules" section in the central panel.
    *   Each available Starship module is listed (e.g., `directory`, `git_branch`, `nodejs`).
    *   **Enable/Disable**: Use the toggle switch next to each module name to enable or disable it.
    *   **Expand Module**: Click on a module's header to expand its settings.
    *   **Format & Style**: Adjust the `format` string (how the module's information is displayed) and the `style` string (its colors and text attributes).
    *   **Module-Specific Properties**: Configure individual properties for the module (e.g., `truncation_length` for the directory module, symbols for git status indicators). Tooltips and descriptions are provided.
    *   **Documentation**: Click the link icon next to the module name to visit the official Starship documentation for that module.

6.  **Manage Palettes**:
    *   In the "Palettes" section (above Modules), you can define color variables.
    *   **Predefined Palettes**: Select a predefined palette like "Nord" or "Solarized Dark" from the dropdown. This will populate the variables.
    *   **Custom Variables**:
        *   Add new variables by entering a name (e.g., `my_custom_blue`) and a value (e.g., `#5e81ac bold` or `blue underline`).
        *   Use the color picker to easily select colors, which will then be combined with other style attributes (like `bold`).
        *   These variables can then be used in your module `style` strings (e.g., `style = "$my_custom_blue"`).

7.  **Observe Previews**:
    *   **Live Preview Panel** (bottom left): Shows an approximation of how your prompt will look. This preview uses dummy data for module variables.
    *   **TOML Preview Panel** (bottom right): Displays the `starship.toml` content that is generated based on your current configuration. This is what you'll save and use with Starship.

8.  **Import Existing Configuration**:
    *   Click the "Import" icon (upward arrow) in the header.
    *   Select your local `starship.toml` file. The editor will load its configuration.
    *   The template selector will indicate "Imported Configuration".

9.  **Export Your Configuration**:
    *   Once you're happy with your setup, click the "Export" icon (downward arrow) in the header.
    *   This will download a `starship.toml` file containing your current configuration.
    *   Save this file to `~/.config/starship.toml` (or the appropriate location for your OS) for Starship to use it.

10. **Get Help**:
    *   Click the "Help" icon (question mark) in the header to open a modal with guidance on Starship concepts, formatting, styling, and Nerd Fonts.

## 💡 Tips for Starship

*   **Nerd Fonts**: For many icons and symbols to display correctly in your terminal (and in the Live Preview), you'll need a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) installed and configured in your terminal emulator.
*   **Format Strings**:
    *   Variables like `$directory`, `$git_branch` are replaced by module output.
    *   Use `[]` to make a section optional (it only appears if the variables inside it have content). E.g., `[on $hostname]`.
*   **Style Strings**:
    *   Combine colors (e.g., `green`, `fg:#ff0000`, `bg:blue`) and attributes (e.g., `bold`, `italic`, `underline`, `dimmed`).
    *   Refer to the [Starship documentation on styling](https://starship.rs/config/#styling) for all options.
*   **Palettes**: Using the `[palette]` table (managed via the Palette Editor) is highly recommended for defining reusable color variables, making your configuration cleaner and easier to maintain.

## Local Development Assets
*   Make sure you have an `assets` folder in the root of the project.
*   Place the application logo, named `image.png`, inside this `assets` folder as it's referenced by `App.tsx` via the path `./assets/image.png`.
